The Contacts section is more like an address book, with details from contacts
you have (usualy through spam report). Every email address you report abuse,
gets stored here, in order to help you keep track of whats going on. 

You can add, delete, modify contacts. The raw whois data is also stored there
to help you identify records. Currently this option is not implemented.
