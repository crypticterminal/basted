Traps are called all the "fake" email addresses that got generated by visitors
of your site. Please note that NOT everyone is a spammer and people might 
still by acident mail your basted (DOH!). Also note that usualy takes
some time for a mail address to get spamed (from the initial creation till the 
actual spamming), so dont be hasty and start deleting records. Have faith 
and your trap will flurish... :P
